  o Major feature (onion service):
    - Onion services can now export the circuit id using HAProxy protocol in
      the per-port service to differentiate client circuits. This can be done
      by putting an optional flag in HiddenServicePort option. Closes ticket
      40530. Patch by Suphanat Chunhapanya (haxxpop).
